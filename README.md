# Test-COVIDPass
COVID Pass is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It is only for screening related to COVID-19. 

This screening aid is based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and Partners HealthCare experts. Screening criteria in other states may be different.

Always consult a medical professional when needed.

To be functional, the application will require access the following:
	-   A service to authenticate users
    -	A service to get additional information about the authenticated user
    -	A backend database to save user attestation data
